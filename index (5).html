        <center><h1>Assignment 2: Static Web: HTML/CSS</h1>
            <p>Due Sunday, January 9 11:59pm PST</p></center>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Accept the Github Classroom assignment and clone this repo that contains stencil code for Assignment 2.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This is a multi-part assignment with the objective of making you comfortable working with HTML and CSS. By
            the end of this assignment, you will have styled some rectangular blocks and created a simple version of
            Twitters home page.</p>
        <p>If this assignment seems overwhelming to you, please come see a TA at TA hours to talk through some
            strategies for tackling it. We expect this assignment to be a time-consuming assignment as we cover a lot of
            fundamental techiniques. But with a good strategy, it can be finished in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
        <p>Note: Only CSS and HTML will be used for this assignment. If you want to use JavaScript (or libraries such as
            jQuery) then feel free to, but we will only be grading correctness on your CSS and HTML.</p>
        <p>If you can, Start Early!</p>
        <h2>Part One</h2>
        <h3>Specifications</h3>
        <p>Now that you understand some of the basics of HTML and CSS, let's take a look at how to align HTML elements.
            There are multiple ways to align HTML elements, but in this part, we recommend using flexboxes as they are
            widely used in modern web development (for example BootstrapV4 is built on top of flexboxes). </p>
        <p>Refer to this great webpage on how to use flexboxes: CSS Flexbox Guide</p>
        <p>Also feel free to use online resources such as Stack Overflow, MDN, W3, and Google for reference. </p>
        <p>When you open the provided HTML file <a href="index.html">IndexPage</a> , it should look like this: </p>

<p>As you can see, there are 9 rectangles. The styling and makeup of the first two rectangles are already built
    for you. Your task is to apply stylings and add div elements inside of the next 7 green rectangular blocks
    to create a webpage that looks like this:

<p>We will describe how each row will behave dynamically and provide some hints for a possible approach: </p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>For the third row, the red and blue end rectangles should remain the same width, and the green space
        should shrink. <br><br>
        <span class="b2">Possible Approach: Have a div with a red background and a div with a blue background,
            both with fixed
            width. Use an appropriate value for <span class="clr3">Justify Content</span>.</span>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>For the fourth row, the blue end rectangle should remain the same width, and the red rectangle should
        shrink. <br><br> <span class="b2">Possible Approach: Have a div with a red background and a div with a
            blue
            background. Have
            a
            fixed width on the blue div. Use <span class="clr3">Flex Grow</span>.</span></li><br>
    <li>For the fifth row, the red square should remain the same size, but always remain in the center of the
        green rectangle. <br><br> <span class="b2">Hint: Think about how to keep a div fixed size and how to
            align
            something in the
            absolute center of the parent element.</span></li><br>
    <li>For the sixth row, the blue rectangle should remain the same size, while the red rectangles should
        shrink. The blue rectangle should remain in the center of the row. <br><br> <span class="b2">Hint: Use
            two
            red divs.</span></li><br>
    <li>For the seventh row, the red rectangle should remain the same width. <br><br> <span class="b2">Hint:
            Nest
            divs and use
            <span class="clr4">background-color: transparent</span></span>
    </li><br>
    <li>For the eighth row, the orange rectangles should remain the same size while the green space between them
        shrinks.</li><br>
    <li>For the ninth row, the green space between the orange rectangles should remain the same width while the
        orange rectangles narrow. </li>
</ol>
<p>The examples we provided with the first two rectangular blocks use flexboxes. You are not required to use
    flexboxes for the next 7 rows, but we recommend it as it will also be useful in part 2 of this assignment.
</p>
<p>You should only have to use the <span class="clr4">div</span> html element to complete this assignment. Also,
    <span class="b1">none of the divs you
        create inside of the provided wrapper divs should have </span> <span class="clr4">background-color:
        green;</span> .
    But it is valid to specify
    non-green background colors for any divs, including the wrapper
</p>
<p>Try to style the boxes as closely to the solution image as possible don't worry about getting exact
    dimensions or rgb values. We care about what structure. CSS styles you used, and the dynamic behavior of the
    page. However just for reference, </p>
<ul>
    <li>The color of the boxes we used are <span class="clr4">background-color:</span>
        <span class="clr6">red</span>, <span class="clr7">blue</span> and <span class="clr8">orange</span>
    </li>
    <li>Some width/height values we used are <span class="clr4">20px, 40px, 80px</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>You are not required to use Bootstrap in this part. You can use if you want, but we actually recommend
    writing plain CSS. Just for this part, inline CSS is acceptable, but you should generally avoid using inline
    CSS in the future. </p>
<h2>General Notes</h2>
<p>As a reminder, it's a good idea to run your HTML and CSS syntax through validators. You should also consider
    using an accessibility checker such as WAVE.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of HTML and CSS tags, properties and values, and we do not expect students to learn each
    one by heart. However. This assignment and the first lab are intended for you to intuitively understand the
    languages. And to be proficient at knowing how to tackle a design by the end of the semester.</p>
<p>If you're having problems, There are many guides on HTML and CSS online (CSSTricks and MDN are your friends)
    as well as on our resources page.</p>
<p>As always if you are stuck on a particular part. You can always talk to the friendly TAs or ask questions on
    course piazza (check your email for a signup link).</p>
<p id="last"> As a general rule of thumb, do not expect TAs to be able to solve every web problem you have. Even
    the most
    adept web developer can struggle a lot with specific CSS rules to use. </p> <br><br><br><br><br>
